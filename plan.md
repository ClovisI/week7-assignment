Plan:

For the next three weeks I will focus on each phase of design as mapped out in this plan.

Week 1:
Research and brainstorm ideas.  Look around for APIs and applications that you enjoy.  Review previously made react applications and think about what you want to accomplish.  Find some APIs.  Think about what you want to make and how it should look.  Take time to really just consider this project.

Week 2:
Start wrapping up your brainstorming.  Have a list of ideas of one or two projects you’d like to make.  Keep considering APIs, with concern to useability and ease of implementation.  Figure out how you could implement this API into a SPA.  Start getting design ideas once you establish an overall form.  Determine the structure, and dependencies of the project.

Week 3:
Start to lay the foundation early week 3.  Make your final wireframes and follow your task list.  Ensure each day you are making progress and don’t overwhelm yourself.  Set up your application and give yourself time to build each block each day.  Make the skeleton, then knock out a major module or two each day.  Get themes and other images towards the end of the week, once the app is functional.  Start uploading and testing application on Sunday/Monday.  Fix any issues these days as well.  Use Tuesday to add any additional updates and polish project.  Test before class to ensure GitHub hosting is working perfectly, and there are no issues.  Have various devices or simulators ready to present responsive design.  Prepare a short presentation.
